      <p>
        This textbook has more freedom than most (but see some exceptions). 
        First, there is no cost to acquire this text, and you are under no 
        obligation whatsoever to compensate or donate to the author or publisher. 
        So in this most basic sense, it is a free textbook. Therefore you can also 
        make as many copies as you like, ensuring that the book will never go out-of-print. 
        You may modify copies of the book for your own use - for example, 
        you may wish to change to a prefered notation for certain objects or add a few new sections. 
        There is a copyright on the book, and subsequently it is licensed with a 
        GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL). It is this combination that allows the author 
        to give you greater freedoms in how you use the text, thus liberating it from some 
        of the antiquated notions of copyright that apply to books in physical form. The main caveat 
        is that if you make modifications and then distribute a modified version, you are required 
        to again apply the GFDL license to the result so that others may benefit from your modifications.
